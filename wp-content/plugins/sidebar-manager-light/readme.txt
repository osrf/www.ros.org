Create custom sidebars (widget areas) and replace any existing sidebar so you can display relevant content on different pages.

== Description ==

Updating to version 1.3 or higher - See the Change log tab.

You can now replace an existing sidebar (widget area) with a custom sidebar for one or group of pages. The content of the new sidebar will be displayed on the exact same spot as the one you select to replace only for those pages you selected.

Once created all custom sidebars will be available in Appearance -> Widgets. You can drop any number of widgets in any of your custom sidebars. They work exacly the same way as the default once.

Add as many sidebars (widget areas) as you need. Creating sidebars (widget areas) is unlimited. 

WMPL plugin support so you can display sidebars and widgets based on language.

Sidebars can be displayed based on User role too.

[Demo site](http://otwthemes.com/demos/1ts/?item=Sidebar%20Widget%20Manager&utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=page&utm_content=upgrade&utm_campaign=sml) | [Create responsive layouts in minutes, drag & drop interface, feature rich](http://otwthemes.com/widgetizing-pages-in-wordpress-can-be-even-easier-and-faster?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=page&utm_content=site&utm_campaign=sml)
 
Examples:

Lets say you would like to display a certain set of widgets on your blog page, different set of widgets on your portfolio, and different set on your contact page. All that on the spot where the primary sidebar of your theme is located. You can do that by creating 3 sidebars replacing the primary sidebar and set each custom sidebar to display on blog or portfolio or contacts.

If you have an advanced theme that has some extra widget areas you can replace those as well. Practically any sidebar (widget area) can be replaced.

This is very easy and fun to do and requires no coding knowledge at all.

How Sidebar Manager Light works:

* Create a custom sidebar
* Choose which sidebar to replace
* Choose pages that will display the new sidebar
* Go to your widgets section and drop some widgets in your new sidebar
